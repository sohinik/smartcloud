# Description
This is an improved platform to display metrics for cloud services. Having used some before, these platforms become bulky and hard to navigate easily. As such, I used this opportunity to improve the current AWS CloudWatch dashboard. Before, the top and side bars were extremely cluttered, especially creating a problem as they are not feasible for intensive use.

I converted many of the above options to dropdowns from the icons, which allows the top bar to collapse and become far more intuitive. Then, I combined several of the options in the side bar to create a more frictionless approach. I also gave the main dashboard area, with relevant graphs, a "mosaic" look to improve the UX.

# About
I used Figma to wireframe this, which proved invaluable as Figma is a great platform for design. The main site is implemented with the regular HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
